      We use a JWT authorization workflow. Use the /api/auth endpoint to get JWT access and refresh tokens. Then use the
      access token in the header "Authorization: Bearer accesstoken.goes.here".  That token will expire in 15 minutes by
      default. When it expires, you'll receive a 401 response code. At that point, use the /api/auth/refresh
      with the header "Authorization: Bearer refreshtoken.goes.here" to receive a fresh access token. When you're done,
      please use the /api/auth/logout endpoint to log out.  See the implementation in the Walkoff App for an example
      implementation.
